-- One LOGIN role per database. Runs as the superuser, on EVERY start.
--
-- Creates a role if absent, and ALWAYS re-asserts its password — that is what
-- makes rotating a ${*_DB_PASSWORD} in docker-compose/.env take effect on the
-- next `up` with no data wipe. `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` cannot do this: it
-- runs only when the data directory is empty.
--
-- Before consolidation every service connected as `postgres` (superuser) with a
-- per-INSTANCE password. That was safe only because the instances were
-- separate. One instance + one shared superuser would mean a single leaked
-- password reaches every database, including the ones it has no business in.
--
-- `keycloak` has no role here: it stays on its own instance (compose service
-- `keycloak-db`) with its own superuser. See postgres/README.md.

-- ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD is echoed verbatim into the server log when
-- log_statement is 'ddl' or 'all'. The default is 'none', but pin it for this
-- session so a server configured to log DDL does not persist five cleartext
-- passwords. (password_encryption defaults to scram-sha-256, so nothing is
-- cleartext at rest.)
SET log_statement = 'none';

-- INHERIT (the default) is load-bearing, not decoration. A database owner is an
-- implicit member of pg_database_owner, which owns schema `public` on PG15+;
-- that membership is only usable if the role INHERITs. Create these NOINHERIT
-- and applying a schema starts failing with "must be owner of schema public".
-- 20-schema-owner.sql makes ownership direct so we do not depend on this, but
-- the two together are the belt and the braces.
